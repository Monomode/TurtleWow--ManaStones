This addon allows you to have a movable button that makes all the Mana Stones of the mage starting from Mana Ruby -> Mana Citrine -> Mana Jade -> Mana Agate.

Installation:
-------------
Type '/ms help' for the available commands

Extra-old working system:
-------------
You can use it as a macro as well by doing the following:
To start using it you need to make a macro with any name you like and write on it the following line:
/ms conjure    --- This command will conjure mana stones
You can make another macro using the following command:
/ms use --- and this command will use the conjure mana stones

Usage:
--------
Then you just hit the same button till all have been conjured. Need FR localization, if anyone want to help contact me.

Troubleshooting:
--------
If you have problems with the Localizations use SwitchLocalizations.bat, that will replace the testing localizations with the tested stable ones.
